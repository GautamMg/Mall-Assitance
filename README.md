Mall Assistance is a software solution designed to simplify the communication between service providers and customers in a mall environment. It provides a direct one-to-one communication channel, enabling service providers to add, delete, and modify items in the mall, while customers can easily search for the products they need, get information on their availability, and receive billing information. The software is divided into four sections for service providers, allowing them to manage their products efficiently. For customers, there are two sections enabling them to search for products and complete purchases. The software generates unique serial numbers for items to facilitate easy billing, and customers can simply input the quantity of their purchases to receive a total amount. Mall Assistance is an all-in-one solution that streamlines mall operations and enhances the shopping experience for customers. This was developed in C language.
